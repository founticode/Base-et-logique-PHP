PHP ARRAYS – SUMMARY

What is an Array in PHP
An array is a variable that can store multiple values in one place.
It helps organize data and avoid creating many separate variables.

Arrays can be created using:

array()

[]

Example:
$colors = ["Red", "Blue", "Green"];

Indexed (Simple) Arrays
Indexed arrays use numeric indexes starting from 0.

Example:
$colors = ["Red", "Blue", "Green"];

Accessing values:
$colors[0] → Red
$colors[1] → Blue

Associative Arrays
Associative arrays use keys instead of numeric indexes.

Example:
$person = [
"name" => "Ismail",
"age" => 22
];

Accessing values:
$person["name"]
$person["age"]

Browsing Arrays (Loops)

Using for loop (indexed arrays):

Often used with count()

Access elements by index

Using foreach loop:

Best and simplest way to browse arrays

Works with indexed and associative arrays

Example (indexed):
foreach ($colors as $color)

Example (associative):
foreach ($person as $key => $value)

count() Function
count() returns the number of elements in an array.

Example:
count($colors) → 3

Common use:

Controlling loops

Knowing array size

Adapts automatically after add/remove

Works with:

Indexed arrays

Associative arrays

array_push()
Adds one or more elements to the end of an array.

Example:
array_push($colors, "Yellow");

array_merge()
Combines two or more arrays into one.

Example:
array_merge($array1, $array2);

unset()
Removes an element from an array.

Example:
unset($colors[1]);

Note:

The index may be missing

count() still returns correct number of elements

Important Notes

Arrays help manage data efficiently

foreach is preferred for arrays

count() is essential for loops

Arrays can store strings, numbers, or mixed data
