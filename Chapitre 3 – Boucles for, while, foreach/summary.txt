📘 PHP Loops – Summary (for .txt file)
🎯 Purpose of Loops

Loops are used to repeat a block of code, iterate over data (arrays), and automate repetitive tasks.

1️⃣ for Loop

Used when you know how many times the code should run.

Syntax:
for (start; condition; increment) {
    // code to repeat
}

Example:
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}

Explanation:

$i = 1 → starting value

$i <= 5 → condition

$i++ → increment after each loop

2️⃣ while Loop

Used when the number of iterations is not known, only the condition.

Syntax:
while (condition) {
    // code
}

Example:
$i = 1;

while ($i <= 5) {
    echo $i;
    $i++;
}

Important:

Always update the variable to avoid infinite loops.

3️⃣ do...while Loop

Executes the code at least once, even if the condition is false.

Syntax:
do {
    // code
} while (condition);

Example:
$i = 10;

do {
    echo $i;
} while ($i < 5);

Explanation:

The code runs first.

The condition is checked after execution.

4️⃣ foreach Loop

Best loop for arrays.

Syntax:
foreach ($array as $value) {
    // code
}

Example:
$colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

foreach ($colors as $color) {
    echo $color;
}

foreach with key and value:
$person = ["name" => "Ismail", "age" => 22];

foreach ($person as $key => $value) {
    echo $key . ": " . $value;
}

5️⃣ break

Stops the loop immediately.

Example:
for ($i = 1; $i <= 10; $i++) {
    if ($i == 5) {
        break;
    }
    echo $i;
}

6️⃣ continue

Skips the current iteration and continues with the next one.

Example:
for ($i = 1; $i <= 5; $i++) {
    if ($i == 3) {
        continue;
    }
    echo $i;
}

7️⃣ Iterating Over an Array (Real Example)
$students = ["Ali", "Sara", "Yassine"];

foreach ($students as $student) {
    echo "Hello " . $student;
}

✅ Key Notes

for → fixed number of repetitions

while → condition-based repetition

do...while → runs at least once

foreach → best for arrays

break → stops the loop

continue → skips one iteration
